# Meet The Team - Eliza

Eliza is a developer at Omniplan, working on our Platform team, developing APIs in C#

Eliza is originally from Poland, but moved to the Netherlands 5 years ago.

Outside of her .NET development she likes to spend her time drawing, doing yoga (sometimes ðŸ˜…), not doing sport ðŸ˜Š

She also enjoys good movies, cats and chocolate!

If you visit Azure Lowlands then will find Eliza on a stage, ensuring that the talks are awesome!
