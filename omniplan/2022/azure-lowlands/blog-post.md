# Omniplan at Azure Lowlands

Summer has arrived, and so the conference season from the first half of the year is over.

Whilst I have been a speaker for a number of years, there were a few firsts this season!

At Omniplan we want to get to meet the people that are shaping the future of the software industry, the developers! And so it was with great pleasure that we sponsored one of the last conferences before the summer break - [Azure Lowlands](https://azurelowlands.com/)!

Azure Lowlands has been running for a number of years now - both in person before the pandemic, and as a virtual event during, and known as a source of expert content for the Azure community.

This year it was back in person, and with a festival theme to end the conference season with not only amazing content, but also a great party!

This was our first time sponsoring, and having a stand, at a technical conference - and we didn't have much time to ensure that we could hit the ground running.

The decision to be at Azure Lowlands was taken a little late and so we had a rush to decide what we wanted to show at the conference. One question was what goodies we were going to have available on our stand for the attendees. Most people really look forward to the freebies that can be found at a conference, but we also wanted to be as sustainable as possible with what we gave away.

This meant no trinkets that looked cool, but were not really useful. Nothing with electronics that were going to end up in landfill within a couple of weeks. Flashing lights on all sorts of things are great, but when the battery runs out you end up with a really wasteful piece of kit. Of course, we also want something that is going to remind the visitors of Omniplan when they use it over a longer time. So something that is going to be useful...

For the short time frame that we had to prepare we went for 3 things:

* Laptop stickers - because we all love a laptop sticker!
* Omniplan branded Tony Chocolonely - because at a conference an energy boost is almost always appreciated. Especially later in the day ðŸ˜…
* Bamboo pens - because even in a paperless world, a pen is still useful!

Whilst Omniplan has never been to a tech conference before, we do have a lot of experience finance conferences, and we have some tools that we can use! One of these is our banner - a wonderful backdrop for our stand! With that and an Omniplan beach mat that we have from a previous company outing we had the static part of our brand ready for the day!

That gave us our stand, where developers from all over the Netherlands could come and talk to our Technical Director, [Rutger](https://twitter.com/Rutix), and one of our tech leads, [Martijn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martijngribnau/).

Then for something more dynamic to attract attention! We decided that we wanted a rolling presentation. Showing both who we are, and the technology that we are using.

Martijn made us a fantastic presentation showing:

* Our application
* Our amazing offices near the Amsterdam Passenger Terminal (and some of the fun activities that we have done for team building)
* Our deployment process (currently using ARM templates to deploy our infrastructure) and the feature flags/Azure DevOps pipelines used for continuous deployment and release.
* Our automated tests - so that we can do the continuous deployment with confidence that we won't break anything!
* And, of course, the monitoring that we have to ensure that we know if something has broken!

These seemed to work and we had some great conversations with the attendees. As we are both new to the community, and as as are a product company rather than a services company there were lots of people curious about who we are, what we do and how we work. The highlight for us was one comment that was in a conversation

> Are these actual test runs and pipelines? Wow! A lot of companies talk about this type of thing but you are actually doing it!

Since starting the rewrite of our application from a distributed monolith to a more service orientated architecture, we have strived to make sure that we could deploy on demand - and in fact deploy with every pull request that we make! It felt great that this was recognized by the attendees!

The whole experience of being involved with the community at this conference has been amazing. Speaking to developers to see what it is that makes their work worthwhile for them, and what they are looking for in the future.

We've met some amazing people, had we've had some amazing conversations, and gotten some great feedback on how we are trying to develop software at Omniplan.

This is definitely something that we want to repeat in the future - both to meet the developers and for the feedback that we got from everyone from Omniplan that was involved.
