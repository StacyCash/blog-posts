In a recent post I mentioned that I have PTSD, an Anxiety disorder and suffer from Depressive Mood Syndrome.

To try and overcome these, and to work on living with them, I've been in therapy for a while.

Last week we were covering the abject nightmare (for me) that is meeting with other people. The stress from beforehand. The stress during, and the stress after.

I'm a geek. I have passions that other people find childish, pointless, weird, a waste of time.

* I love computers, and playing/experimenting with them
* I love Doctor Who
* I love 50s Swing style and spend most of my days looking like I'm going to a prom
* Whilst I don't love scary movies, I love creepy outfits and several of my swing dresses have halloween vibes
* I love Lego!
* l love streaming my Lego building on my (OTT) computer setup, whilst wearing swing dresses... ðŸ˜›

What I don't love are the constant comments from people who don't love these things telling me that I'm wasting my time doing pointless things, that they find what I like boring, or childish and to remember how old I am.

In one of exercises we were walking through how I experience family gatherings. I reached the point of the conversations and how I experience them. How I wish I could answer all the criticism

> Well it works for me and makes me happy.

And at that point I was reminded of a quote attributed to John Barrowman (Captain Jack of Doctor Who fame)

> "Never apologize for being nerdy, because unnerdy people will never apologize for being assholes."

I hope I can live up to that. I love my hobbies and interests. They  make me happy.

Be yourself. You're worth it.

> I may not be perfect, but I'm fine as I am
