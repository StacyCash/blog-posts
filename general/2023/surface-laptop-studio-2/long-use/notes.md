# Notes for extended use review

## Networking issue

Caldigit TS4 just refused to work full stop. The surface just doesnt see the network adapter at all
No brand dongle worked, but did not give good results (650Mbos on Dell XPS 15, 250Mbps on Surface Laptop Studio 2)
MS Surface Dongle gave 700Mbps (pretty much what I would expect)

## Screens Issue

Screens suddenly deactivated. No idea why, but I had to install the Intel Display Control Center to get them to funtion again.

[Control Center - check it's the right one](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/intel%C2%AE-graphics-control-panel/9NDLCLMMTMRC?hl=en-US&gl=US)

Don't think that this was a Surface issue, but it happened...

(incidentally at the same time my XPS 13 Plus flipped it's lid - that was not a fun morning!)
