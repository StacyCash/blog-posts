# Notes for extended use review

## Networking issue

Caldigit TS4 just refused to work full stop. The surface just doesnt see the network adapter at all
No brand dongle worked, but did not give good results (650Mbos on Dell XPS 15, 250Mbps on Surface Laptop Studio 2)
MS Surface Dongle gave 700Mbps (pretty much what I would expect)

## Screens Issue

Screens suddenly deactivated. No idea why, but I had to install the Intel Display Control Center to get them to funtion again.

[Control Center](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/intel%C2%AE-graphics-control-panel/9NDLCLMMTMRC?hl=en-US&gl=US)

Don't think that this was a Surface issue, but it happened...

(incidentally at the same time my XPS 13 Plus flipped it's lid - that was not a fun morning!)

## Charging

Boo. Whilst it will charge from USB-C - it doesn't matter what you plug in, it refuses to see anything other than a slow charger.

If you are at a place where you can use the Surface charger, thiis is not a problem.

But I can count on one hand how often I use the original charger with my Laptops:

- I grab whatever is closest, sometimes that is a slow charger, sometimes it's not
- I'm on the go - I won't be taking the surface charger traveling with me. I'd rather take one that can charge all my devices
- I need to charge where there are no sockets - i.e. Powerbanks! Using a 100W power bank should charge the Surface at full speed. It doesn't.
- My studio. I use a TS4 docking station that provides enough power to charge the Surface. But... Nope. It's a slow charger to this laptop

I have no idea why there is this limitation. I can't help but think that the Surface connector should have just been retired and proper USB-C charging used...
