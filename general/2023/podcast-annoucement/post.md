Hey everyone, I have some exciting news to share with you all: I'm starting a podcast!

Yes, you heard that right, I'm going to be talking about all kinds of topics that interest me and hopefully you too. But before you get too hyped up, there's a catch: I'm only going to start the podcast after my health has improved somewhat.

For those who have seem my posts on LinkedIn or Twitter, you'll know that I am struggling with long-covid right now. It's totally thrown my life into disarray... I've not been able to work for months, I've had to cancell all my conferences since February and I've just not got the energy for much...

And I don't see it improving substationally in the short term. But I do want to do things with the community aqgain. 

But don't worry, I'm not giving up on my podcast dream. I already have some ideas for episodes and guests that I think you'll love. And as soon as I feel ready, I'll start recording and uploading them for you to enjoy. I promise it will be worth the wait.

So stay tuned for more updates on my podcast journey. And in the meantime, take care of yourselves and each other. Peace out!
