> Don't work too hard.<br />Relax!<br />You're no use to anyone burnt out.

I hear these things often - and I agree with them. Totally.

But agreeing to them, and doing something about them are not the same thing...

I find it hard to turn off. I find it very hard to do either nothing (really, really not my thing) or something "unproductive". Both of these states lead to mental breakdowns for me.

Until this week... Where the weather had been nice enough for us to set-up our pool. That we bought for our child. Honestly, I'm not even joking here! This isn't Lego!

The pool that we have is not big, but at 2.4m and 70cm tall it holds *a lot* of water. Too much to drain every couple of days, it's a waste of time, money and - of course - water. So over the last year I have had to get a minimal understanding of pool chemistry, and the pool stays up all summer!

The upshot (and the reason I told the whole story )... We have a pool, heated by the sun, which we can use any time we want to!

And I do. Most days after I'm finished work, before I need to cook. And make sure to finish work in time to do that.

*40 minutes floating in warm, clear water. Ebook in hand relaxing.*

You see in the pool I have no distractions. I'm in the moment.

I'm not being distracted byt the world around me. I'm not looking into the kitchen wondering if I should be cooking yet.

I'm not being distracted by the program onto the TV.

I'm just in the pool, reading.

And I have noticed the change in energy levels after just doing this for a week. 

> Note: as I type this it's coming up for the end of the day, in a hot and stuffy attic and I have zero energy ðŸ¤£)

I appreciate that I am in the luxury position of having a garden for the pool, and for the summer, in good(ish) weather at least, I plan on using it daily.

Later in the year I have the interesting task of finding something in home that replicates this feeling. But that is a job for later in the summer.

Right now it's time to learn to enjoy the feeling!

Ad as it's 5pm now it's time to go and jump in!

Look after yourselves, and remember to allow yourself time to take a break!
