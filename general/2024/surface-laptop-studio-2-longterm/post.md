## Intro

## TL;DR;

### Notes

Really enjoyable machine to use
Keyboard is one of the best I have used, full stop
Trackpad is on a par with MacBook Pro - seriously, nothing better to say!
Performance enough for what I was doing
Assuming the processor is updated to be up to date when I need a new machine, this will be on the list

### The Good, Bad, And Ugly

#### Good

That keyboard. Chef's kiss
That trackpad. Ditto
Screen that is so crisp, 120Hz
Tablet mode

## Bad

Strange software issues - not the laptops fault, but really odd
USB-C Connectors on one side making use with a docking station annoying
No HDMI even though there is space on the chassis

## Ugly

Non upgradable ram. Seriously, boo!
Surface connector for charging - could have been another thunderbolt port!

## Screen

Crsip and clear
120Hz
Not 4K resolution (boo)
3K * 2K thought - great for vertical space when coding
Resolution is that I can use it at 100% without having to squint
Great viewing angels

## Keyboard

Wow. Just wow.
You can feel how solid that chassis is!
No flex!
It sounds similar, and feels similar to a MacBook Pro keyboard
Layout is great - I wasn't accedentally hitting caps lock instead of A or missing the enter key as I can on other laptop keyboards that have odd layouts (HP Spectre 360 I am looking at you here!)
I could type all day on that keyboard without pain and without getting frustrated

## Tablet and Slim Pen 2

Screen hinge
So much better than the up and over style of convertibles
Simple to change, no moving the machine, no waiting for the screen to flip
Large enough screen to use as a desktop bound tablet
Not that big that it becomes unweildy

The pen itself is very strange, but in a good way
With the machine turned off, it feels like any other pen on glass
Turn it on and the haptic feedback you get mimics a pen going across paper
Not perfect, but the best pen that I have used on all my devices
I hope others take not and implement something similar
I miss having that pen now!

## Noise

This is an intel machine, it's a laptop, it has a discrete GPU
It has a lat of ventilation around the left and right sides of the laptop
I was expecting it to be similar in volue to my Dell XPS 15.
I was wrong
The design choice (which I think is a little Marmite - you either love of hate it, I love it) means that the air comes from the side (so you can put it on your lap)
And it allows a lot of air to easily circulate (I didn't reove the bottom of the case, but I get the idea there is space inside)
That means that the fans rarely turned on for me
And when they did it wasn't loud, not close to the XPS even when running a benchmark
Day to day use I only really noticed the fans when I turned the machine off and they stopped, leaving silence

## Heat

But all that wasn't at the expence of heat!
For work I use an XPS 13 Plus. A powerhouse of a 13" laptop - it's brilliant!
But you can also fry eggs on it even when the fans are running

My XPS 15 i9 gets quite warm, though nothing like the 13...

My MacBook Pro 13" M1 just doesn't get warm. I'm not sure that I've felt it get above room temperature. I have heard the fans once or twice, but that's it.

This sits between the XPS 15 and the MacBook Pro. But way closer to the MacBook Pro than the XPS! Maybe the coolest windows laptop I have used in a long time.

## Performnance

### Memory Limitations

A note about the performance of the machine. I was only given the 16GB version of the laptop. For thr work that I do that is nowhere near enough.
Looking at the fact that the memory was on 100% all of the time I am sure that with the right memory configuration this machine has more to give

## Battery Life

Again... With the machines I use often

XPS 13 Plus: more than a couple of yours you are going to need to charge it!
XPS 15 i9: with development work I get between somewhere around 4 or 5 hours I think.
MacBook Pro: Do I need to say it? Everyone knows that these things can go all day without an issue!

SLS2? Prabably nicely between the Mac and the XPS 15. I could use it most of the day without a recharge (I get the idea that the fans don't have to work stupidly helps...)
Though if I was out of the house, I would still make sure that I had a charger with me, something that I don't do with the Mac...

## Weight

2Kg

Â±200g more than the XPS 15
500g more than the MacBook Pro

But... It didn't really fell it when carrying it about (I honestly thought it was the same as the XPS 15 until I looked up the specs for both online). I could carry it around with ease, lighter would be nice, but I wouldn't want to trade the cooling or how it feels for that weight...

## Camera and Sound

OK, not spectacular, but better than the XPS cameras. Maybe better than the MacBook Pro camera, but I'm not sure

I hated that the AI chip in the machine would only work with the build in camera though
If that could have worked with any camera on the system it would have a lot more use!

The speakers are great, as any modern high quality laptop speakers should be these days!
Not too boomy, not too tinny and didn't crap themselves when the volume was turned up! Lovely.

Whilst the MacBook Pro and Dells have different sounds, I wouldn't say that any was better than the other, just that they are different. This falls into the same category for me. Unless you are expecting HiFi quality, I don't think that you woul dbe dissapointed

## Day To Day Use

### Software issues

Surface software
Annoying to use
Switched between has to be in surface software and taking you to windows settings
Should just be standard functionality in windows...
