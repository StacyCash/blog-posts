First up... If I am going to talk about widgets then I also have to show my age...

back in the early 90s lots of beer started to be served with widgets to make them foamier... I'm too young to tell you if it was a good idea or not, but I can tell you that widgets in the web are a great idea!

## So What Is A Widget

Widgets, or more accurately **Custom Elements** are a way of exposing your code to other people's websites without them having to install anything. They are a way of creating reusable components that can be dropped into any website with just a link to your script, and a simple script tag.

For more information about Custom Elements, you can check out the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements).

In this series we are going to look at how to create custom elements using different frameworks, starting with Vue.js.

## Starting our Vue application

> Full disclosure: I am not a Vue developer, I code in C# for my day job. This post is about how I got the Vue custom elements working for me, if I have done something hideously wrong - please **politely** let me know in the comments. I am always looking to learn.

We need to make a Vue application - but when I tried this using the Vue CLI I found that the scaffolded application was just over the top. So here I am going to start from scratch and hope for the best ðŸ˜… (If there is a way of scaffolding an app without all the extra things I don't need, then please let me know!)

In an empty folder, I ran the following commands:

``` ps
git init
mkdir src
mkdir public
npm init -y
npm install -D @vue/compiler-sfc
npm install -D vite
npm install @vue/tsconfig
```
