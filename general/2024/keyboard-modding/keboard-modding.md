YouTube. It's a great way to waste a lot of time. Especially when ill and you can't do anything else.

I've watched loads of car, ASMR cleaning, tech and purely random content over the last 18 months. Recently I've watched a huge amount of 3D Printing content (because of my new toy - I want to learn how to use it right).

And... Keyboards. I'm a geek, unashamedly, and watching people build and mod keyboards is awesome! The difference that you can make to a keyboard just by a few simple things is amazing.

I did want to treat myself to a new keyboard - I've had my current Skarkoon Purewriter RGB for about 10 years now and it can be a little finiky, and, well, I just wanted to try something different.

But... My budget is being spent elsewhere at the moment, trying to get a NAS big enough to store our movie collection, so that we can watch them without having to sort through the discs...  Ho-hum choices have to be made.

So instead I started thinking about other options. What changes can I make to my current keyboard to make it better. There are lots of limitations:

- It is low profile, so there are limited choices in hardware, and I wasn't sure if I could even change my switches
- Sharkoon use "special" switches which mean my choice of keycaps is limited
- I have no money to spend so I have to start off with things around the house before I move onto actually spending money.

Oh, and my brain means that I don't plan these things. I had the idea at 11am, by 12 they keyboard was in bits - so no pictures I'm afraid (it really should have been a video! I can always take it apart again, let me know if it would be fun to watch).

Dismalteling was easier than I expected. Pull off all the keykaps (after taking a picture) and undo some screws. The top plate then just lifts off and you have it.

But... The switches are soldered, so I couldn't do anything with them. They also seem to be soldered from the other side of the top panel -  so I can't even take out the PCB... Hmm...

And lastly, the stabalisers look nothing like I have seen on any  keyboard channel - so I assume that they are not interchangable with other sets. My options are looking  more and more limited.

Literally the only thing that I could so was add sound deadening material to the base and see if I could change the clacky sounds to more of a thonk.

So I thought about what I could fill it with. I had some stickly door edge draft excluder (rubber foam stuff - technical term)... That covered about half the bottom half of the case.

Put it back together and OMG! The difference was night and day. All of a sudden all of the clackyness had gone and some satisfying thonking had replaced it (whilst still keeping the clickyness of the clicky switches!). But it wasn't perfect. Where I ran out of the rubber foam you could hear the difference in the sound of they keys. So I had another look and... Bubble wrap was all I could find - from some printer parts that were delivered.

So I cut that into rectangles to put into the rest of the keyboard base and BOOM! the rest of it sounded pretty similar. At some point I will get some more draft exluder and stream replacing the bubble wrap - but for now... I'm over the moon with the difference in sound!

Oh, I also took the time to clean the keys with alcohol. Wow, Considering that they didn't look dirty, they were gross ðŸ«£

For now I'm done with the one that I have, but I think that I am going to revisit the custom keyboard idea later in the year to see what options there are to really make a personal keyboard!
