Making the unboxing video for dot net frontend day

Live streams, fine, no problem. If it goes wrong laugh about it and continue

Recording... Er, no.
It has to be perfect, just because there is a remote possiblity that it **can** be perfect.

So lets unbox, and build, the speaker gift.

I went wrong, I mis-spoke repeatedly, I completely messed up building K9

And... I didn't rebuild! I just continued and enjoyed it!
