# Learning

For the last year or so I've been playing with Static Web Apps, writing talks based on it, and making my own website using them.

Earlier this year there was a new tool which also came into preview: Static Web App CLI.

And NPM package that allows you to run your code application locally, making it look like it's hosted in a Static Web App.

And so... I thought that I would try this out and write a talk around it. Gulp.

This is a new one for me. I generally write my talks around tools which are already in use, and help introduce them to it.
