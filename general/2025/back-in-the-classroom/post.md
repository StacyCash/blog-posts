For the last few years I have been lucky enough to be invited to speak to students studying software and DevOps at [De Haagse Hogeschool](https://www.dehaagsehogeschool.nl/). The course is facilitated by [Delta-N](https://www.delta-n.nl/), sharing their expertise with the new generation!

And that sharing is why I also love being asked to do these things. For the last 2 years I have been speaking about Pair Programming, a topic I love talking about - because when done right you can really see the benefits that it brings.

This year, I wanted to change it up a little. I was already writing a new talk on testing first so thought this would be a great opportunity to try it out in the real world, before taing it to confernces.

It's also terrifying. When you speak on stage at a conference or meetup there the people there want to be there. They actively went to the conference, and to your talk. All you have to do is make sure that you make it worth their while.

Students are something else. They have to be there, you have entered their lecture space. Eek.

Even worse - I had zero slides because my slide deck was not ready - it was just me talking and them listening. Hopefully not bored. The bright side was that if I could make it work in this situation, I can make it at a conference.

The talk that I gave was [Testing First](#) (post coming soon). About how if we want testing first to really work then we need to think beyond "just TDD to implement your solution" and more into the world of solving problems for actual users.

And that means getting involved earlier in the process, talking to (if possible) actual users. But at the very least the testings and busines people working on your project with you.

From the reaction that I got from the students in the room I think that I reached a few people, and at the very least made them think about what is possible. Whether talking at a conference, or to students, getting people to think about what I've said is the best thing that I can ask for.

Hopefully I get to go back next year, maybe with another new talk!
