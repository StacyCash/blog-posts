We've been working from home for 18 months now. Something that I actually quite like. But then I am in the lucky enough to have the space to set-up a dedicated work space. My studio in the attic.

There was one (admittedly, luxury) problem. Since moving into the house the rooms that we were not using often, kind of turned into dumping grounds for things to be organised 'later'. Haha. Yes, later...

This meant that our workspace was a little messy. With starting the stream I've been wanting to make my backdrop neater, more interesting, to give myself more space. To allow me to (finally) set-up the green screen I got last year.

This weekend became the time to actually do that.

I've spent the day emptying the shelves in the studio. And refilling them with Lego and other ornaments. Something that looks quite cool.

The only books left are:

* My university books
* Current software development books
* Books about various agile practices
* Cook books

All the rest, the out of date books I couldn't get around to throwing out, coffee tables books that I rarely, if ever, read have been moved to our library (which at the moment also looks more like a dumping ground).

It's been a hard slog, in fact it's took me literally 10 hours just to clear the shelves and put them back as I want them to be. And I then I had the same again to actually get the room usable!

Because whilst the shelves were looking great after the first 10 hours, the rest of the room looked worse than ever, because of the things that were not yet sorted.

It's not that I had time to sort them - that is a job for much later - but they needed to be packed up and moved to the library (otherwise known as another dumping ground).

Moving the desk so that those awesome shelves are behind me, and organising cables was another long job. Making it neat is hard, and due to hardware failure atfer the move it's already a mess again!

Haning up the green screen ona  curtain wire above the shelves was the last job - ensuring that I could have a green screen on demand! Rather than the previous 30 minutes setting it up when I wanted to use it.

And then I realised that I needed a new office chair - because the desk has to be higher, so a wobbly standup chair it is! Let's work on my posture at the same time!

And, for now, done!

## Next Steps

The room still had another desk that needs emptying. But not yet. Sorting old electronics, and making space for a sewing machine to come.

I wan to play with lighting and sound absorbtion too. I have the idea that this is a task that will have constant improvements to it. Never finished, but always getting better!

For now it's "good enough" and we can work on the spare room, removing the double bed that is never used, and turn it into an office for my partner so that she doesn't have to work in the living room!

But that's for another weekend!
