We've been working from home for 18 months now. Something that I actually quite like. But then I am in the lucky enough position to be able to set-up a work space.

There was one (admittedly, luxury) problem. Since moving into the house the rooms that we were not using often, kind of turned into dumping grounds for things to be organised 'later'. Haha. Yes, later...

This meant that our workspace was a little messy. With starting the stream I've been wanting to make my backdrop neater, more interesting, to give myself more space. To allow me to (finally) set-up the green screen I got last year.

This weekend became the time to actually do that.

I've spent the day emptying the shelves in the studio. And refilling them with Lego and other ornaments. Something that looks quite cool.

The only books left are:

* My university books
* Current software development books
* Books about various agile practices

All the rest, the out of date books I couldn't get around to throwing out, coffee tables books that I rarely, if ever, read have been moved to our library (which at the moment also looks more like a dumping ground).

It's been a hard slog, in fact it's taken me literally 10 hours so far, to clear the shelves and put them back as I want them to be. And I think that I have the same again yet to come.

Because whilst the shelves are looking great right now, the rest of the room is looking worse than ever, because of the things that are not yet sorted.

It's not that they are going to get sorted tomorrow. That comes later. But they need to be moved to be packed into boxes/bags and moved into the library.

The the desks in the study need to be rearranged so that my desk has those awesome shelves behind me. That mean unplugging *all* the cables and moving two heavy desks, the 19" rack with the sockets and audio equipment.

And if there is time, drilling a hole in a seriously solid wall so that I can hang up the green screen.

I am not looking forward to it.

I am looking forward to the result though!

Here is the story so far!
