# OBS: Mask You Inputs

After not being online since January, I'm finally starting to get to the point where I think I can manage some content creation again!

Lego, coding, reviews, and talks. All things that OBS is going to be invaluable in order to make what I produce look as good as I can get it.

My own set of scenes in OBS were set up a long time ago, with a view to improving them as time went by. Lack of time, and then illness meant that never happened, so they are still the basic ones I started with.

And I decided to begin with the camera view when sharing a screen/desk camera. Specifically I wanted to make it look a little neater than it does at the moment.

Right now I simply have my camera feed at the bottom of the screen as a box. But... I wanted something that looked more... Spangly. A round window that took up less space, and looked better at the same time.

## Basic Instructions

- Find the input source that should be masked
- Right click the source and select `Filters`
